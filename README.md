This CRAN Task View contains a list of packages useful for scientific work in Archaeology, grouped by topic. Note that this is not an official CRAN Task View, just one I have prepared for my own convenience, so it includes some packages only on GitHub and other non-CRAN resources I find useful. Many of the most highly recommended packages listed here can be installed in a single step by installing the [tidyverse](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidyverse) package.

Besides these packages, a very wide variety of functions suitable for scientific work in Archaeology is provided by both the basic R system (and its set of recommended core packages), and a number of other packages on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and [GitHub](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages?type=github). Consequently, several of the other CRAN Task Views may contain suitable packages, in particular the [Social Sciences](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/SocialSciences.html), [Spatial](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/Spatial.html),  [Spatio-temporal](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/views/SpatioTemporal.html), [Cluster analysis](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Cluster.html), [Multivariate Statistics](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Multivariate.html), [Bayesian inference](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html), [Visualization](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Graphics.html), and [Reproducible research](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html) Task Views.

Contributions to this Task View are always welcome, and encouraged. The source file for this particular task view file resides in a GitHub repository (see below), and pull requests are the preferred method for contributions.

## Data acquisition

-  The ideal method is to export your spreadsheets from Excel (or whatever program you made them) as CSVs (comma-separated-values, a simple, non-proprietary plain-text-based format that is very transparent, being human-readable, easily machine-processable and suitable for archival storage) and read them into R using the base function `read.csv()`. Data in other types of plain text files can be read in with `read.table()`.
-  To read Microsoft Excel files into R there is [readxl]( https://github.com/hadley/readxl). OpenDocument Spreadsheet files can be read into R using [readODS](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/readODS/index.html).
-  For working with untidy and/or complex Excel spreadsheets (i.e. many tables in one sheet, coloured cells, cells with formulas, etc.), use [jailbreakr](https://github.com/rsheets/jailbreakr), [xlsxtractr](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/xlsxtractr), [tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) and [unpivotr](https://github.com/nacnudus/unpivotr)
-  Text data (as in sentences and paragraphs) can be read in and analysed with the [tm](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/tm/index.html) package or [tidytext](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tidytext). If the text is in a Microsoft Word file, use [textreadr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=textreadr), or if it's a PDF file, use [pdftools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pdftools). Text in image files can be extracted with [tesseract](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tesseract)
-   For quickly reading in a very large number of CSV files, or very large CSV files, use `fread()` from the [data.table](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/data.table/index.html) package or functions in the [readr](https://github.com/hadley/readr) package. For plain text (CSV, TSV, etc) files that are too big to fit in memory, use [chunked](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=chunked) to read and operate on them in small chunks.
-   [RODBC](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RODBC/index.html), [RMySQL](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RMySQL/index.html), [RPostgreSQL](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RPostgreSQL/index.html), [RSQLite](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RSQLite/index.html) for connecting R to SQL databases. [RODBC](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/RODBC/index.html) can connect to Microsoft Access databases.
-   The [haven](https://github.com/hadley/haven) and [foreign](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/foreign/index.html) packages can be used for reading and writing files from certain versions of Minitab, S, SAS, SPSS, Stata, Systat and Weka.
-   ESRI shapefiles can be read using [rgdal](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rgdal/index.html) or [maptools](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/maptools/index.html)
- R can receive data directly from the web using [rvest](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rvest/index.html), [httr](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/httr/index.html), [XML](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/XML/index.html), [jsonlite](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/jsonlite/index.html), [RSelenium](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSelenium/index.html) (requires Selenium 2.0 Remote WebDriver). R can be programmed to be a web-scraper using rvest and/or Rselenium. The [Web Technologies](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/WebTechnologies.html) task view gives more details.
- Google spreadsheets can be read into R using the [googlesheets](https://github.com/jennybc/googlesheets) package
- Tables can be read directly from Microsoft Word documents with [docxtractr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/docxtractr), and from PDF documents with [tabulizer](https://github.com/leeper/tabulizer)
- Datasets from the Open Context repository can be browsed and read into R using the [opencontext](https://github.com/ropensci/opencontext) package

## Data manipulation

-   [dplyr](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/index.html) and [data.table](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/data.table/index.html) for splitting the data up by groups, applying some common or custom functions, and combining the output back into a convenient form (ie. typical aggregation, splitting and summarising operations). Both packages are fast on very large datasets.
- For cleaning, examining, and making quick summaries of data, [janitor](https://github.com/sfirke/janitor), [skimr](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/skimr), [statar](https://github.com/matthieugomez/statar), and [xda](https://github.com/ujjwalkarn/xda) maybe useful. [tabplot](https://github.com/mtennekes/tabplot/) has functions for exploratory data visualisation of tables
- [tidyr](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/tidyr/index.html) for rearranging the data from long to wide forms, and more complex reshaping.
- [purrr](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/purrr/index.html) simplifies working with lists, applying functions to list elements and collecting the results
- [broom](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/broom/index.html) takes the output of many built-in functions in R, such as `lm` or `t.test`, and turns them into tidy data frames.
- [measurements](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/measurements/), [convertr](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/convertr), and  [units](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/units) converts between metric and imperial units, or calculate a dimension's unknown value from other dimensions' measurements.

-   [tabplot](https://github.com/mtennekes/tabplot/) for exploratory data visualisation of tables
-   For schematic diagrams, such as Harris matrices, [DiagrammeR](https://github.com/rich-iannone/DiagrammeR) is useful.
-   For colour schemes in plots: [viridis](https://github.com/sjmgarnier/viridis) for perfectly perceptually-uniform colours, [RColorBrewer](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/index.html), [wesanderson](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wesanderson/index.html), and [munsell](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/munsell/index.html) for exploring and using the Munsell colour system, and for some extra themes for ggplot2, including some Tufte-inspired themes, see [ggthemes](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggthemes/index.html).

### Multi-panel plot layouts

- To combine and align multiple ggplot2 plots (and other image types) in one panel:
- use [cowplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cowplot/index.html) for a publication-ready theming and labelling
- [patchwork](https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork) for a simple grammar using `+`, `/`, etc
- [gridExtra](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/gridExtra/index.html) for configuring layouts with a matrix
- [multipanelfigure](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=multipanelfigure), perhaps the most versatile for combining different elements

## Analysis in general

-    Base R, especially the stats package, has a lot of functionality useful for analysing archaeological data. For example, `chisq.test()`, `prop.test()`, `binom.test()`, `t.test()`, `wilcox.test()`, `kruskal.test()`, `mcnemar.test()`, `cor.test()`, `power.t.test()`, `power.prop.test()`, `power.anova.test()` among many others. [Hmisc](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Hmisc/index.html) includes bootstrapping, setting confidence intervals, and power analysis functions, see also [psych](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/psych/index.html) for useful descriptive statistics and visualizations.
-    [corrr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/corrr/) contains many convenient functions for exploring correlations.
-    Bayesian and resampling variants of these also exist, for example in the [MCMCpack](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MCMCpack/index.html), [BEST](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BEST/index.html) (requires JAGS), [Bayesian First Aid](https://github.com/rasmusab/bayesian_first_aid) (also requires JAGS) packages (see the [Bayesian](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html) task view for more) and the [coin](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/coin/index.html), [boot](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/boot/index.html), and [bootstrap](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bootstrap/index.html) packages (see also [msm](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/msm/index.html)).
-    For analysing change over time, [bcp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bcp/index.html), [changepoint](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/changepoint/index.html), [ecp](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ecp/index.html), [AnomalyDetection](https://github.com/twitter/AnomalyDetection) and [BreakoutDetection](https://github.com/twitter/BreakoutDetection) provide functions for detecting distributional changes within time-ordered observations.
-    [abc](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/abc/index.html) provides functions for parameter estimation, model selection, and goodness-of-fit.

## Analysis of categorical and count data

- The `table()` function in the base package and the `xtabs()` and `ftable()` functions in the stats package construct contingency tables.
- The `chisq.test()` and `fisher.test()` functions in the stats package may be used to test for independence in two-way contingency tables
- The `assocstats()` function in the vcd package computes the Pearson chi-Squared test, the Likelihood Ratio chi-Squared test, the phi coefficient, the contingency coefficient and Cramer's V for plain or stratified contingency tables.

## Linear, generalized linear models, and non-linear models

-  Linear models can be fitted (via OLS) with `lm()` (from stats). The [modelr](https://github.com/hadley/modelr) package has helper functions for pipeable modelling (e.g. cross-validation, bootstrapping). For data from a non-normal population, or when there are apparent outliers, [lmPerm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lmPerm) computes linear models using permutation tests.
-  Bayesian fitting of linear and non-linear models is possible with [rstanarm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rstanarm),  [brms](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms), and [rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking).
-  The `nls()` function (from stats) as well as the package [minpack.lm](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/minpack.lm/index.html) allow the solution of nonlinear least squares problems.
- Correlated and/or unequal variances can be modeled using the `gnls()` function of the [nlme](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/nlme/index.html) package and by [nlreg](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/nlreg/index.html). The nlme package is supported by Pinheiro & Bates (2000) Mixed-effects Models in S and S-PLUS, Springer, New York.
-  The generic `anova()` function in the [stats](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/stats/index.html) package constructs sequential analysis of variance and analysis of deviance tables, and can compute F and likelihood-ratio tests for nested models. (It is typical for other classes of statistical models in R to have anova methods as well.) The generic anova function in the [car](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/car/index.html) package (associated with Fox, An R and S-PLUS Companion to Applied Regression, Sage, 2002) constructs so-called "Type-II" and "Type-III" tests for linear and generalized linear models.
- [cerUB](https://github.com/Andros-Spica/cerUB) for multivariate statistic protocols for integrating archaeometric data (geochemical, mineralogical, petrographic)

## Multivariate statistics

-   The [Cluster task view](http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Cluster.html) provides a more detailed discussion of available cluster analysis methods and appropriate R functions and packages.
-  [caret](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/caret/index.html) and [FactoMiner](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/FactoMiner/index.html) are popular packages with a suite of multivariate methods

Model Testing and Validation

- [caret](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/caret/index.html) provides many functions for model training, testing, and validation. There is also Max Kuhn's excellent companion book called "Applied Predictive Modeling" (Springer, also available as an ebook). The [mlr](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mlr/index.html) package also provides classification, regression, and machine learning methods.
-  Other packages that enable tuning and evaluation of models include bootstrap and [Hmisc](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/Hmisc/index.html)
- The [CVtools](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/CVtools/index.html) and [DAAG](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/DAAD/index.html) packages include cross-validation functions for evaluating the optimality of tuning parameters such as sample sizes or number of predictors etc., in statistical models
- [rsample](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rsample) creates different types of resamples and corresponding classes for their analysis

Hierarchical cluster analysis

-    The package [cluster](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/cluster/index.html) provides functions for cluster analysis following the methods described in Kaufman and Rousseeuw (1990) Finding Groups in data: an introduction to cluster analysis, Wiley, New York
-    There are also `hclust()` in the stats package and `hcluster()` in [amap](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/amap/index.html)
-    [pvclust](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/pvclust/index.html) is a package for assessing the uncertainty in hierarchical cluster analysis. It provides approximately unbiased p-values as well as bootstrap p-values. Enhanced plotting is also available through the [dendextend](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dendextend/index.html) package.
-    [dendextend](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dendextend/index.html) Offers a set of functions for extending dendrogram objects in R. It allows to both adjust a tree's graphical parameters - the color, size, type, etc of its branches, nodes and labels - as well as visually (and statistically) compare different dendrograms to one another.

Other partitioning methods

-   `kmeans()` in stats provides k-means clustering and cmeans() in [e1071](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/e1071/index.html) implements a fuzzy version of the k-means algorithm. The recommended package [cluster](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/cluster/index.html) also provides functions for various partitioning methodologies.
-    To compute the optimum number of clusters there is the `pamk()` function in the [fpc](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/fpc/index.html) package, `cascadeKM()` in [vegan](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/vegan/index.html), `Mclust()` in [mclust](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/mclust/index.html), `apcluster()` in [apcluster](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/apcluster/index.html)

-   Principal coordinates analysis (PCO) is implemented in `dudi.pco()` in ade4, `pco()` in labdsv, `pco()` in [ecodist](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ecodist/index.html), and `cmdscale()` in package [MASS](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/MASS/index.html).
-    Non-Metric multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) is provided by `isoMDS()` in package MASS and `nmds()` in [ecodist](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ecodist/index.html). `nmds()`, a wrapper function for `isoMDS()`, is also provided by package [labdsv](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/labdsv/index.html). vegan provides helper function `metaMDS()` for `isoMDS()`, implementing random starts of the algorithm and standardised scaling of the NMDS results. The approach adopted by vegan with `metaMDS()` is the recommended approach for ecological data.
- `corresp()` and `mca()` in MASS provide simple and multiple correspondence analysis respectively. [ca](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ca/index.html) also provides single, multiple and joint correspondence analysis. `ca()` and `mca()` in ade4 provide correspondence and multiple correspondence analysis respectively, as well as adding homogeneous table analysis with `hta()`. Further functionality is also available within vegan co-correspondence is available from cocorresp. [FactoMineR](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/FactoMineR/index.html) provides `CA()` and `MCA()` which also enable simple and multiple correspondence analysis as well as associated graphical routines. [CAinterprTools](https://github.com/gianmarcoalberti/CAinterprTools) has functions for correspondence analysis and diagnostics.
-    Seriation methods are available in [seriation](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/seriation/index.html), which includes `bertinplot()` for producing battleship plots, and [CAseriation](https://github.com/gianmarcoalberti/CAseriation) which also has a battleship plotting function.
-    [tabula](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/tabula) provides methods to analyse and visualise archaeological count data (artifacts, faunal remains, etc.) using diversity measures and Ford (1962) and Bertin (1977) diagrams.
- [dimensio](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dimensio) provides a set of tools to compute, extract, summarize and visualize results of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Correspondence Analysis (CA) based on the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). It also includes methods for partial bootstrap validation.

Dissimilarity coefficients

- `dist()` in standard package stats, `daisy()` in recommended package [cluster](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/cluster/index.html), `vegdist()` in [vegan](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/vegan/index.html), `dsvdis()` in [labdsv](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/labdsv/index.html), `Dist()` in [amap](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/amap/index.html), `distance()` in [ecodist](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ecodist/index.html), a suite of functions in [ade4](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ade4/index.html), and [rdist](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/rdist/index.html) for very fast distance computations.
- [simba](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/simba/index.html) provides functions for the calculation of similarity and multiple plot similarity measures with binary data (for instance presence/absence data)
- `distance()` in the [analogue](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/analogue/index.html) package can be used to calculate dissimilarity between samples of one matrix and those of a second matrix. The same function can be used to produce pair-wise dissimilarity matrices, though the other functions listed above are faster. `distance()` can also be used to generate matrices based on Gower's coefficient for mixed data (mixtures of binary, ordinal/nominal and continuous variables). Function `daisy()` in package [cluster](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/cluster/index.html) provides a faster implementation of Gower's coefficient for mixed-mode data than `distance()` if a standard dissimilarity matrix is required. Function `gowdis()` in package [FD](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/FD/index.html) also computes Gower's coefficient and implements extensions to ordinal variables.
- [DistatisR](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/DistatisR/index.html) provides functions for three-way multidimensional scaling for the analysis of multiple distance/covariance matrices collected on the same set of observations.
