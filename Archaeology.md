This task view is a list of packages useful for archaeological science. It includes packages for working with distinctive types of archaeological data, such as radiocarbon ages, various types of artefacts (lithics, pottery, etc.), faunal remains, geoarchaeological and landscape data, packages containing archaeological datasets, and packages from closely related sciences, such as environmental science, that are widely used by archaeologists. This is a list to help archaeologists in their search for packages relevant to their research. It does not include packages for general purpose tasks such as importing/exporting data, data manipulation, common forms of data analysis and visualization, and doing reproducible research. These may be found in other CRAN Task Views, especially `r view("Environmetrics")`, `r view("Spatial")`, `r view("Multivariate")`, `r view("Phylogenetics")`, `r view("Cluster")`, `r view("ReproducibleResearch")`, `r view("WebTechnologies")`, `r view("MachineLearning")`, and `r view("SpatioTemporal")`. To minimise overlap we do not include those packages in this list. This list assumes some familiarity with using R and is not an introduction to using R in archaeology (see the links below for introductory resources).

Within each thematic section, you will find first the packages distributed on CRAN, followed by a selection of code projects in other repositories. Please keep in mind that the order in which packages are listed should not be taken as an indicator of quality or endorsement.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to the task view maintainers or the maintainers of specific packages. If there is an archaeological science package on CRAN or elsewhere that we have missed, please let us know. Contributions are always welcome, and encouraged -- please see the linked GitHub repository for details.

If you are looking for more open source archaeological software and resources (including R packages), [open-archeo](https://open-archaeo.info/) is the ideal complement to this taks view.

### Analysis of Dates and Chronological Patterns

#### Radiometric Dating

Radiocarbon ages can be calibrated using many of the packages in this section:

- `r pkg("rcarbon", priority = "core")` is useful for calibration, and also contains extensively documented functions for hypothesis testing and modelling radiocarbon ages. See Crema and Bevan ([2021](https://doi.org/10.1017/RDC.2020.95)) for an introduction. Basic calibration is also possible with `r pkg("rintcal")`.
- `r pkg("Bchron")` adds various calibration curves (including user generated ones); also does age-depth modelling, relative sea level rate estimation incorporating time uncertainty in polynomial regression models, and non-parametric phase modelling via Gaussian mixtures as a means to determine the activity of a site (and as an alternative to the Oxcal function SUM). `r pkg("clam")` similarly does 'classical' age-depth modelling of deposits.
- `r pkg("ananke")` allows simple radiocarbon calibration and chronological analysis. It also provides tools for visualising results and estimating statistical summaries.
- Bayesian age-depth modelling of radiocarbon dates is available in `r pkg("nimbleCarbon")` and `r pkg("rbacon")`.
- `r pkg("coffee")` uses Bayesian methods to enforce the chronological ordering of radiocarbon and other dates, for example for trees with multiple radiocarbon dates spaced at exactly known intervals.
- `r pkg("oxcAAR")` allows you to use R to connect to a local installation of the OxCal software to calibrate radiocarbon dates and a variety of other OxCal operations.
- `r pkg("ArchaeoPhases")` allows you to post-process Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations from [ChronoModel](https://chronomodel.com/), [Oxcal](https://c14.arch.ox.ac.uk/oxcal.html) or [BCal](https://bcal.shef.ac.uk/). It provides statistical tools to analyze and to estimate archaeological phases from the posterior distribution of a sequence of dates and includes testing procedures to check the presence of a gap between two successive phases.
- `r pkg("spDates")` allows analysis of spatial gradients in radiocarbon dates.
- `r pkg("IsoplotR")` offers a statistical toolbox for radiometric geochronology.

- `r pkg("tidypaleo")` provides a set of functions for age-depth model management, stratigraphic visualization, and common statistical transformations.

#### Archaeological Time Series

- `r pkg("era")` provides a consistent representation of year-based time scales as a numeric vector with an associated era. `r pkg("aion")` contains a toolkit for handling archaeological time series.
- `r pkg("aoristic")` and `r pkg("kairos")` provide functions for the aoristic analysis of archaeological data (takes into account the uncertainty of the exact moment that an event occurred when examining the overall incidence of events over time).
- `r pkg("kairos")` provides functions for mean ceramic date estimation.
- `r pkg("SPARTAAS")` and `r pkg("kairos")` provide methods for statistical pattern recognition, time range plotting and seriation plots of archaeological artefacts.
