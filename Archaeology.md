This task view is a list of packages useful for archaeological science. It includes packages for working with distinctive types of archaeological data, such as radiocarbon ages, various types of artefacts (lithics, pottery, etc.), faunal remains, geoarchaeological and landscape data, packages containing archaeological datasets, and packages from closely related sciences, such as environmental science, that are widely used by archaeologists. This is a list to help archaeologists in their search for packages relevant to their research. It does not include packages for general purpose tasks such as importing/exporting data, data manipulation, common forms of data analysis and visualization, and doing reproducible research. These may be found in other CRAN Task Views, especially `r view("Environmetrics")`, `r view("Spatial")`, `r view("Multivariate")`, `r view("Phylogenetics")`, `r view("Cluster")`, `r view("ReproducibleResearch")`, `r view("WebTechnologies")`, `r view("MachineLearning")`, and `r view("SpatioTemporal")`. To minimise overlap we do not include those packages in this list. This list assumes some familiarity with using R and is not an introduction to using R in archaeology (see the links below for introductory resources).

Within each thematic section, you will find first the packages distributed on CRAN, followed by a selection of code projects in other repositories. Please keep in mind that the order in which packages are listed should not be taken as an indicator of quality or endorsement.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to the task view maintainers or the maintainers of specific packages. If there is an archaeological science package on CRAN or elsewhere that we have missed, please let us know. Contributions are always welcome, and encouraged -- please see the linked GitHub repository for details.

### Analysis of Dates and Chronological Patterns

#### Radiometric Dating

Radiocarbon ages can be calibrated using many of the packages in this section:
